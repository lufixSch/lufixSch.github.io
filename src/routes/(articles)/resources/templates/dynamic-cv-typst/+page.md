# Dynamic CV

Typst toolbox for dynamically generating CVs based on YAML files.

## Usage

First clone this repository in the directory where you want to create your CVs. To get started create at least one YAML file containing your _personal information_ with the following structure:

```yaml
# Full name of the individual
name: John Doe

# Birth information (optional)
birth:
  # Date of birth
  date: "01.01.1980"
  # Place of birth, can be multiline
  place: |-
    New York City
    USA

# Citizenship (optional)
citizenship: United States

# Gender (optional)
gender: Male

# Address (optional), can be multiline
address: |-
  123 Main St
  Springfield
  IL 62704

# Phone number (optional)
phone: "+1 555 1234 567"

# Email address (optional)
email: "johndoe@example.com"

# Profile picture (optional)
picture: "path/to/profile/picture.png"
```

Other information like education, work or skills can be written using one of two schemas.

**Timeline Schema**

```yaml
# List of the item
- title: "Bachelor of Science (BSc)"
  # Importance Level (optional), should be a number between 1 and 3 (defaults to 3)
  importance: 3
  # Description (optional), can be multiline
  description: "Computer Science, University of Example"
  # Attendance dates
  date:
    # Start date
    start: "09/2015"
    # End date (optional)
    end: "07/2019"

- title: "Professional Certification in Data Analysis"
  # Custom date label
  date: "Custom date label"
```

**Category Schema**

```yaml
# First category
- category: "Language Skills"

  # Importance Level (optional), should be a number between 1 and 3 (defaults to 3)
  importance: 3

  # List of items in that category
  items:
    # Name of the skill
    - name: English
      # Importance Level (optional), should be a number between 1 and 3 (defaults to 3)
      importance: 3
      # Description or details, can be multiline
      description: Native speaker

# Second category
- category: "Computer Skills"

  # Items in this category as one string
  items: |-
    Proficient in LaTeX, Typst.
    Familiar with LibreOffice and OpenOffice.
```

Naturally all YAML schemas can be extended with custom keys and values if needed.

Start your Typst document with the `cv` template. Provide the paths to your YAML files in the `paths` argument. `personal` is required further paths with arbitrary names can be added depending on your need.

```
#import "lib.typ": *

#show: cv.with(
  // Paths to your YAML files
  paths: (
    personal: "personal.yaml",
    education: "education.yaml",
    work: "work.yaml",
    skills: "skills.yaml",
  ),

  // CV Configuration
  cfg: config_translations.en

  // Default column ratios for tables
  columns: (1fr, 3fr),
)
```

Afterward you have access to the `config` and `information` state variables to build your document.

```
#context config.get()
#context information.get()
```

The information from your YAML files can then be displayed in a structured way using the `personal_table`, `timeline_table` or `category_table` function.

```
#context {
  let cfg = config.get()
  let info = information.get().personal

  personal_table(cfg, info, profile)
}
```

> NOTE: If the personal config contains a profile picture path, the `profile` function is used to place the picture.
> Use `profile.with(...)` with custom parameters to change the position of the picture.

### Utility Functions

This repo provides further utility functions to make parsing of the YAML files and building a CV easier.

- `get_date`: Convert `date` from YAML file into corresponding string.
- `signature`: Draw a signature field with place and date.

### Importance

The `importance` key is a way to adjust the size and complexity of your CV according to your need. The `importance` of you CV is provided with the configuration:

```
#let cfg = config_trasnlations.en
#cfg.insert("importance", 2)
```

Given this value functions like `personal_table` and `timeline_table` will only display items with an importance **greater** than or **equal** to this value.

## Styling

The output generated by the different `*_table` functions uses `table` to structure the information. It can therefore be styled by changing the appearance of a table.

```
#show table: ...
#set table(...)
```

The emphasized text can be styled by changing the appearance of a `strong` element.

```
#show strong: set text(red)
```
